<h1>Coding Challenge 7</h1>

<p>
    Suppose that you're working in a small town
    administration, and you're in charge of two
    town elements:
    <ol>
    <li>Parks</li>
    <li>Streets</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    It's a very small town, so right now there are
    only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets
    have a name and a build year.
</p>
<p>
    At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final
    report with the following:
<ol>
    <li>Tree density of each park in the town (no. of trees/park area)</li>
    <li>Average age of each town's park (sum of all ages/no. of parks)</li>
    <li>The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees</li>
    <li>Total and average length of the town's streets</li>
    <li>
        Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge.
        If the size is unknown, the default is normal.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    All the report data should be printed to the console.
</p>
<p>
    HINT: Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings,
    default parameters, maps, arrow functions, destructuring etc.
